Unsong scraper
--------------

[Unsong](http://unsongbook.com) is a novel by Scott Alexander. Read it.

As Unsong is a serial novel, we get updates mostly as they are written.
More critically, if the author decides that he has to change a previous
chapter retroactively, we can find out about this, because that chapter
has already been published. This is an useful side channel, especially
in a story like Unsong, which relies heavily on the form of words
themselves. (For example, see
[this](https://github.com/florolf/unsong-scrape/commit/6833f38f49b2eb8949108a8d768b71f27d899544)

theory.)
